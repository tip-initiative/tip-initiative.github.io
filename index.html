				<h2>About The TIP Initiative</h2>

				<p>
				The TIP initiative was created to develop and publish open interface standards for the
				broadcast industry. Broadcasters, agencies, and system providers are encouraged to
				migrate to an updated common interface ‘language’. Any player in the industry, or
				external to it, could choose to adopt the open standards, thereby pushing forward with
				<u>innovation, automation, competition and interoperability</u>.
				</p>

				<h2>TIP Framework Design</h2>

				<p>
				This data and data model design framework is online. It changes frequently with agreed changes from the industry.
				<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J1v6ol6hSEWSlUPF4ZPMq-TMc_See3ZprvwjS_HqZic">The current TIP Framework is here.</a>
				</p>

				<h2>TIP Interface Releases</h2>

				<p>
				The TIP interfaces for buyers and sellers are periodically released as a full set of
				new and updated APIs on these sites in a published format.
